# Summary

## Objective

The purpose of the plugin is to load standard P111 navigation datasets and produce a layer containing a _single line_. The line can be merged with other layers within QGIS if required, but upon load, it remains in its own layer.

## Method

* review the Python plugin tutorial
* learn how to create a layer
* load and parse the file
